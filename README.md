*Built for the NVIDIA x Vercel Hackathon (World’s Shortest Hackathon 2025) 🎉*

## What is this?

A simple AI-powered tool to help local businesses create personalized marketing — without needing a marketing team.

You fill out your business info, and the platform generates:

- 🎯 Targeted email & SMS campaigns
- 📱 Social media posts (with captions & hashtags)
- 🤖 A smart chatbot trained on your business tone
- 📊 A dashboard to track it all

We built this using **Next.js**, **Vercel**, and **NVIDIA NIM / OpenAI models** — designed to deploy fast and scale.

## Why we built it

Most small businesses don’t have time or money to run marketing — but they all want more customers.

We wanted to build a super simple tool where:

✅ The business owner fills out **1 form**  
✅ The platform handles the rest: email, social posts, chatbot  

---

## Core Features (V0)

✅ Business intake form → stores business details  
✅ AI lead scoring (basic)  
✅ Campaign generator (email & SMS)  
✅ Social post generator (AI-powered captions)  
✅ Chatbot tuned to business info  
✅ Simple dashboard (Next.js frontend)  
✅ One-click deploy on Vercel
