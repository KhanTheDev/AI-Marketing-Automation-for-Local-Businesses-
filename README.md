Demo Project similar to LiftBrand.ai (Due to confidentiality, liftBrand.ai files are private) – Built to Show What’s Possible with AI + Automation

P.S. This is a simple demo project showcasing liftBrand.ai, I am in charge of the softare operation of liftBrand.ai, and we currently have several clients (local businesses located in NYC), signed up and working with us to scale their store.
